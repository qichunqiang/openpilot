<details><summary><h3>💭 Updates on Branch Names and Links</h3></summary>

---

As of May 2025, we are updating the way branches are named and how links are generated. We had initially intended to use a branch naming system similar to openpilot and sunnypilot where there was a "stable" or "release" branch which included all fully vetted code, and then "staging" or "beta" branches with new code that would eventually move into the stable/release branches.  However as we evolved we found everyone liked being able to bounce between newer and older branches to compare features and control. Moving forwards all releases will simply be named bp-"feature release number" as an example "staging-1.1" which features the bluepilot 1.1 features (custom tuning) will become "bp-1.1".  We will not delete older branches so that anyone can go back and view older code for references.  Branches that no longer work properly will be denoted as -deprecated.

To install any version of bluepilot, use the following URL formula (URL is case sensitive)

installer.comma.ai/BluePilotDev/"branch name"

For example

installer.comma.ai/BluePilotDev/bp-5.0

will install the **bp-5.0** branch (current release based on SunnyPilot v2025.001.000).  Branches known to no longer work due to changes in the comma codebase will be appended with -deprecated so it will be obvious they will not install or work correctly.

<details><summary><h3>🌞 What is bluepilot?</h3></summary>

---

[bluepilot](https://github.com/bluepilotdev/bluepilot) is a fork of the hugely popular SunnyPilot project for the Comma3 and Comma3X.  The goal of BluePilot is to develop, test, and stage Ford specific enhancements, validating them before submission to the SunnyPilot team for inclusion in the parent project.

**BluePilot bp-5.0** is based on **SunnyPilot v2025.001.000** and includes all upstream sunnypilot features plus Ford-specific enhancements. This release runs on AGNOS 13.1 and brings significant improvements to the UI, settings management, and onroad experience.

### Upstream SunnyPilot Features
BluePilot includes **all** features from the upstream SunnyPilot project. For a complete list of sunnypilot features and changes:
* **[CHANGELOG_SP.md](CHANGELOG_SP.md)** - Complete sunnypilot changelog with all upstream features
* **[README_SP.md](README_SP.md)** - Full sunnypilot documentation and feature descriptions

Key upstream features include: MADS (Modular Assistive Driving System), Neural Network Lateral Control (NNLC), Dynamic Experimental Control (DEC), Speed Limit Assist (SLA), Intelligent Cruise Button Management (ICBM), Smart Cruise Control Map & Vision (SCC-M / SCC-V), Driving Model Manager with 86+ models, sunnylink integration, and much more.

<details><summary><h3>⛔ Prohibited Safety Modifications</h3></summary>

---

All [official sunnypilot branches](https://github.com/sunnyhaibin/sunnypilot/branches) strictly adhere to [comma.ai's safety policy](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/SAFETY.md). Any changes that go against this policy will result in your fork and your device being banned from both comma.ai and sunnypilot channels. This same stipulation applies to all bluepilot instances as well.

The following changes are a **VIOLATION** of this policy and **ARE NOT** included in any sunnypilot branches:
* Driver Monitoring:
    * ❌ "Nerfing" or reducing monitoring parameters.
* Panda safety:
    * ❌ No preventing disengaging of <ins>**LONGITUDINAL CONTROL**</ins> (acceleration/brake) on brake pedal press.
    * ❌ No auto re-engaging of <ins>**LONGITUDINAL CONTROL**</ins> (acceleration/brake) on brake pedal release.
    * ❌ No disengaging on ACC MAIN in OFF state.

<details><summary><h3>⚒ Installation</h3></summary>

* bluepilot not installed
  1. [Factory reset/uninstall](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-reset-the-device) the previous software if you have another software/fork installed.
  2. After factory reset/uninstall and upon reboot, select `Custom Software` when given the option.
  3. Input the installation URL based on the desired branch. Example: ```installer.comma.ai/BluePilotDev/bp-5.0``` (note: `https://` is not required on the comma three)
  4. Complete the rest of the installation following the onscreen instructions.

* bluepilot already installed and you installed a version after 0.8.17?
  1. On the comma three, go to `Settings` ▶️ `Software`.
  2. At the `Download` option, press `CHECK`. This will fetch the list of latest branches from sunnypilot.
  3. At the `Target Branch` option, press `SELECT` to open the Target Branch selector.
  4. Scroll to select the desired branch

### User Interface & Experience
* **Completely redesigned settings menu** - Reorganized into focused panels (Device, Display, Network, Vehicle, Toggles, Cruise, Steering, Developer, Visuals) for better navigation
* **Enhanced BluePilot Sidebar** - WiFi status with SSID and signal strength, improved network info card, removed constant fan animation (now shows memory usage only)
* **Improved Onroad Rendering** - Enhanced lane lines, road edges, and path rendering with glow effects and smoother curve tracking
* **Routes Panel (Beta)** - View dashcam footage directly on the device with video playback, web-based routes viewer for logs and cereal data
* **Brightness Control System** - Perceptual brightness correction for better viewing experience with more responsive adjustments
* **Model Info & Drive Stats Widgets** - Real-time onroad display of model information and enhanced drive statistics

### Software & Management
* **New Software Panel** - Integrated updater with branch management, model selection interface, git manager integration, and improved power management
* **Models Panel** - Easy switching between different driving models without reinstalling branches
* **Developer Tools** - Customizable debug panel with adjustable settings, conditional building, crash detection system with better error reporting
